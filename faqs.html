                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>A basic virus scan using consumer antivirus software can detect and remove many common threats, but it has limitations. Professional virus removal services like ours offer several advantages:
                        <ul>
                            <li>We use multiple professional-grade tools that can detect threats consumer software might miss</li>
                            <li>We can identify and clean infections in system areas that regular scans can't access</li>
                            <li>We repair damage caused by the malware, not just remove the infection</li>
                            <li>We implement preventative measures to protect against future infections</li>
                            <li>We can recover data that might be encrypted or hidden by ransomware</li>
                        </ul>
                        Our comprehensive approach ensures your system is truly clean and secure.</p>
